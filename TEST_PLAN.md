□ Login System (existing users, new users)
□ Guest Mode (anonymous usage)
□ Password Change (current password validation)
□ Profile Management (user switching)
□ Dashboard Navigation (all buttons functional)
□ Error Handling (network, invalid inputs)
□ Performance (launch time, memory usage)
□ Accessibility (screen readers, contrast)
□ Cross-device Compatibility (different screen sizes)
```

### Bug Tracking System
- **Tool:** GitHub Issues or Jira
- **Categories:** Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Labels:** UI, Database, Authentication, Performance
- **Priority Matrix:** Impact vs. Effort
